        <h1>Work experience</h1>
        <h2>Logic Information Systems</h2>
        <p>Provided thorough IT support and services to whom we have installed
            Oracle Retail Merchandising Systems. I specialized to meet our client’s
            needs on database, server and script related issues. Additionally, I developed additional functionalities for their retail systems according to their
            requests</p>
        <h3>Work Milestones</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a custom functionality that would help our client’s system to
                recover lost prices before they are applied in their respective stores. This
                was a temporary fix that would prevent losing sales in our stores by applying incorrect prices while the root cause was fixed</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in our client’s system in which there was duplicate data
                being created.</li>
            <li>Initiated the support team in Logic Information Systems’ Mexico Branch
                and was responsible to provide support to our most active client.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Redesigned an existing website implementing user sessions, allowing
                them to consult their remaining debts with our client. This project was developed using Javascript, HTML and implementing the Django to upgrade
                the past design.</li>
            <li>Designed a graphic input interface ran with Blockly blocks representing
                the code of our compiler’s language. This project was developed with
                Python for our compiler and Javascript in our graphic interface.</li>
